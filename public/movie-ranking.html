<h1>The best movies according to Zarine Harutyunyan</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>This is one of my favorite movies. I like the idea and the values that are being promoted. It doesn't matter what;s your initial physicalor psyychological condition, you can achieve everything in life, it is like a box of chocolade - you never know what's inside!!!</p>

<h3>Sweet November</h3>
<p>"Sweet November" passes off pathological behavior as romantic bliss. It's about two sick and twisted people playing mind games and calling it love.</p>

<h3>Maxine's Baby: The Tyler Perry Story</h3>
<p>There's no denying at this point that he's one of the most fascinating people in show business: a transformational figure in the movie and TV industries.</p>
